# AlphaZero_in_Pan

## Install
Just do `uv run main.py`.  
If you want to train NN, also do `uv sync --group ml`

## Project details
The following project aims to implement the AlphaZero algorithm in the card game Pan. Our dream is to create a strong engine that will easily defeat every human being and conquer the world (in the game of Pan). 

Our package manager is uv. As our deep learning backbone we will use the JAX ecosystem. Ruff will be used for formatting. Pytest will be utilized for unit tests. Typechecking will be done using pyright. CI/CD will utilize github actions.

The visualization of the game will be of the secondary importance, however we hope to create a simple interface in terminal.
